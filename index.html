		<h2>Sports:</h2>
	 <p>First of all, I love sports: during my life, i did a lot of tennis.This brought to me the ability to know how i worked alone.Secondy i did rugby  who tought me how to work with a team.
	    After that i did French box, i still prcticing but alone with a punching ball and it helps me to express my feelings but also to know about my strenght

		<h2>Reading:</h2>
     <p>I think reading is very important for any human being, books are a legacy from our ancestors and they can teach us a lot about mistakes we have to never do, or things we can do to have a better life or make a better world.They are great because they teach us how to speak in our own language.And finally it makes us imagine and develop our creativity.I think creativity is an essential quality to make your life easier/better.

	 <h2>hang out:</h2>
     I think that times of relaxation are very important to the balance in life, in fact if we don't have these times we cannot be efficient at work or in any other activity.
